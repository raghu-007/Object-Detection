# Object-Detection

Object detection is the automatic inference of what an object is in a given image or video frame. It’s used in self-driving cars, tracking, face detection, pose detection, and a lot more. There are 3 major types of object detection – using OpenCV, a machine learning-based approach, and a deep learning-based approach.
